## Introduction

Welcome to our Skin Disease Diagnosis project! This project leverages the power of the Xception architecture to diagnose skin diseases using images as input. Early and accurate diagnosis can make a significant impact on patients' lives, and this project aims to provide a tool to assist healthcare professionals in their work.

## Features

- State-of-the-art Xception architecture for accurate diagnosis.
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing skin images using tkinter library.
- Fast and efficient image processing for real-time results.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow 2.x
- Keras 2.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter

## Dataset

We used the Skin Disease Dataset for training and testing our model. This dataset contains a diverse set of skin disease images for robust model training.

## Model

We used the Xception architecture for our model. Xception is a deep convolutional neural network that is widely used for image classification tasks. It is a powerful architecture that can achieve high accuracy on a variety of image classification tasks.
